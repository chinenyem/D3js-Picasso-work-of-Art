# D3js-Picasso-work-of-Art

The purpose of this was to create an image. Be able to click on the image to produce a div with html. Started to use just a square for now. Then be able to click on the group element to produce a line to connect to another group element. Right now I am getting to step 3 click on a group produce a line to connect to another group. Instead its just creating lines. Plus I have the drag feature on it to.
